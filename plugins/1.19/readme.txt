HELLO KP-PVP!

SINCE BUILD-69 VERSION KP-PVP NOW REQUIRES KP-CORE PLUGIN AND A MYSQL DATABASE

1.13 VERSION DONT REQUIRES THE CORE! ONLY 1.8-1.12 AND 1.14-1.19

IN THE DEPENDENCY FOLDER THERE IS MY CORE PLUGIN THAT YOU NEED TO INSTALL IN YOUR PLUGINS FOLDER

WHEN PLUGINS LOADS GO TO KP-CORE FOLDER AND FILL OUT MYSQL DATABASE CREDENTIALS AND RESTART THE SERVER!
